# LCP_Project
Code for the "Time-scale correction of radio-nuclide data" project made during Laboratory of Computational Physics Mod.B

The STAN fold for Python code includes:
- Model definition code;
- 'Main' code to perform inference and save the chains;
- 'Variables' code to import the data of the initial spectrum;
- 'Visualization' code to analyse the chains;
These codes are  for the different series 


The Timedeppar fold for R code includes:
- Data fold with datasets;
- 'Main' code to perform inference and save the chains;
- 'Variables' code to import the data of the initial spectrum;
- 'Visualization' code to analyse the chains;
These codes are  for the different series

The Data fold which contains all datasets.
