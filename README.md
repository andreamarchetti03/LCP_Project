Code for the "Time-scale correction of radio-nuclide data" project made during Laboratory of Computational Physics Mod.B
There is a STAN fold for Python code which includes:
- Model definition code;
- 'Main' code to perform inference and save the chains;
- 'Variables' code to import the data of the initial spectrum;
- 'Visualization' code to analyse the chains;
These codes are  for the different series \


There is a Timedeppar fold for R code which includes:

- 'Visualization' code to analyse the chains;

These codes are  for the different series

There is a Data fold which coontains all datasets.
